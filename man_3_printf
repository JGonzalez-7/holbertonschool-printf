.TH _PRINTF 3 "November 2025" "Holberton School" "Library Functions Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- custom formatted output conversion function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
writes formatted output to the standard output stream.
It is a lightweight reimplementation of the C library function
.BR printf (3)
using a small set of conversion specifiers. Characters in the format string
that are not part of a conversion directive are written verbatim. Each
conversion directive begins with the '%' character and is followed by a
single conversion specifier described below. Output is performed through the
internal
.B _putchar()
helper, which wraps
.BR write (2)
to file descriptor 1.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B _printf()
returns the number of characters written to stdout.
If
.I format
is
.BR NULL ,
or if the final character in the format string is '%' with no following
specifier, the function returns -1.
Errors from the underlying
.B _putchar()
are not propagated; a failed write decreases the character count but does not
force an early return.

.SH FORMAT SPECIFIERS
The implementation supports the following conversion specifiers:

.TP
.B %c
Write a single character (argument type:
.IR int ).

.TP
.B %s
Write a null-terminated string (argument type:
.IR char\ * ).
If the argument is
.BR NULL ,
the string "(null)" is printed.

.TP
.B %%
Write a literal percent sign.

.TP
.B %d
Write a signed decimal integer (argument type:
.IR int ).

.TP
.B %i
Write a signed decimal integer (synonym for
.B %d
).

.SH BEHAVIOR WITH UNSUPPORTED SPECIFIERS
Any character following '%' that is not one of the supported specifiers is
printed literally, prefixed by '%'.
For example, the directive "%q" outputs "%q".
Both characters contribute to the return count.

.SH LIMITATIONS
This educational implementation does not support:
.IP \[bu] 2
Flags (+, space, #, 0, -)
.IP \[bu] 2
Field width or precision
.IP \[bu] 2
Length modifiers (h, l, ll, etc.)
.IP \[bu] 2
Additional specifiers such as u, o, x, X, p, f, or custom format handling
.IP \[bu] 2
Buffered output identical to the C standard library
.IP \[bu] 2
Propagation of write errors beyond a reduced character count

.SH EXAMPLES
Print mixed text and supported specifiers:
.PP
.nf
    _printf("Hello %s!\\n", "world");
    _printf("Letter: %c, Number: %d%% done\\n", 'A', 75);
    _printf("Fallback on unknown: %q\\n");
.fi

.SH NOTES
Compile the project sources with:
.PP
.nf
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
.fi

This function is intended for Holberton School coursework and demonstration
purposes and is not a drop-in replacement for the full standard library
